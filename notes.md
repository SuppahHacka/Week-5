# Week-5

### Task1- Plot & Poster
Modyfing the plot using Adobe Illustrator and making an academic poster. 

- My choice in using Illustrator for this task is just my prior knowledge of the software as my focus is actually in design. 
  - I am fairly certain that inkscape would have worked fine but Illustrator is also more powerful. This meant I did not have to explode the pdf and seperate the elemts of the plot as Illustrator automatically identified the image and broke it down into vectors. 
  - Once I had this plot imported into Illustrator, I cleaned it up and polished it a bit as per our task. 
  
    1. Setting rulers and colours

    The rulers helped me to make sure all elements of the plot were lined up properly. Thus, increasing the visual consistency of the plot and making it easier to follow. I also repositioned the title on the y axis, making it easier to read and not intrusive the the data presented. 
    
    2. Adding the legend and the final aesthetic choice.

    The colour palette was chosen from tColor Brewer, suited for accesibility first and aesthetic second. The finishing touches were added and the legend defines the reason behind the data being different shades. Additionally, all data points had a border applied to them as some did not have it before (I believe this was an error within Illustrators pdf import). 
    
    ### Poster 
    Without diving into too much detail (I will reserve that for my reflection), I had a lot to think about and consider with this poster task. The ressources are a good start to understand design thinking and certain "rules" applied within the world of design. Without going into too much detail, here is my poster and what will follow is my inspiration and a bit of how I got to such a final design.

    Now, to explain myself. 
    The ironic title is not to nonchalantly make a cheesy design claim, but rather, to highlight the many problems design is plagued with. "Less is more" is a concept not only used in design but applied in many practical contexts where it is sufficient to speak or do less. The work I created is inspired by my personal values as a designer and my passion for simplyfing the work we do and to give it visual appeal. I believe in digital history, we all play a responsibilty in ensuring our work is readable, without plagueing it with walls of text and over the edge design language. 
    Here are the few takeaways to my design approach: 
    - Simple: Think of shapes and colours that do not take away from the content of what you want your readers to focus on. But rather, design the aesthetics around the content to ensure transperency. The examples provided by Dr. Graham did not show much of what designs essence actually is. Rather, I found myself distracted with the title that seemingly tried so hard to belong. 
    - Aesthetic choice: When we think aesthetic, we often think "pretty". But aesthetic as design language is to ensue attractiveness. That does not necessarily imply making things beautiful, but rather, approachable. The colours you choose and the shades of that colour in application mut compliment your design intent and allow the content room to breathe. Additonally, fonts are also very important, as comically (no pun intended) mentioned by Dr. Graham's reference to Comic Sans. 
    - Consitency: Perhaps one of the most important concepts in good design. Consistent design is design that is easy to follow from beggining to end. It has a flow and is not disrupted by any needless elements. Additionally, content is lined up and measured within your canvas to find its place and give it visual cohesiveness.

    Those 3 points were the main driving factors to my final design. I will explain more about design idealogy as well as my gripes with some of the ressources available in this week's content.
