# Thoughts on Week 5 

This refletion will be more focused on design related topics and the reflection of the materials available as ressources to design. 

1. In this point, I would like to highlight my influence as a to-be designer on this weeks content. It has allowed me a good oppurtunity to express my design philosophy in the context of
of digital history (in a way). While posters are everywhere, academic ones are left to be desired... Very rarely have I seen an academic poster that invites me to want to know more about it. 
That in itself is very telling of the work digital historians must do in order to convey their findings. However, the blame does not fall upon historians, but to the standards we know globally for 
the representation of information. Personally, I have walked around hallways on campus and found these engineers academic posters that are just WALLS of text with a few misplaced pictures. It really
does not invite anyone to read it quite frankly. 

2. Having stated my personal experience, here are a few things I would suggest all academic researches do: 
  a. Read a book called "The Design of Everyday Things". This book explains how design serves as the connection between the object and the design. 
  This goes without saying that this book will explain how our way of design can either strengthen or weaken our endgoal. 
  b. Find inspiration from alternative sources. following the protocol just encourages laziness. It takes someone to challenge a system in order to bring change upon it.
  As far as design goes, pinterest is a good source for broad inspiration and Google can help suggest many ressources that help convey design in the presentation of our information. 
  c. Do what you think and not what you are told. Inspiration comes from within. You cannot paint somebody elses canvas. No one can tell you how to write an academic poster but you shouldn't copy what eveeryone
  else is doing either. You are your own person. Find a way to integrate your flair into your research in a way that presents it with the same level of proffesionalism and authenticity. 
  
3. Lastly, I would like to point out that not everything you see online is true to what the reality is. The ressources shared by Dr. Graham on the website are great starting points. But it really isn't convincing when
you visit a site that talks about how to design and it looks like an archive of a website created in 1990. It's like visiting engrish.com (if you want a good laugh, go visit it!). It has some sense of irony to it, where you excpect the outcome to be a realization 
of the message that is trying to be communicated, but you are met by the opposite. 
That is why I did not make use of those ressources very well. It was rather uninviting and I did not want to waste my time scrolling through a bunch of text. 

Now, let me clarify that I do hold a bias that you, Dr. Graham, will not find amongst my peers I suppose. As a designer myself, there is lots to ponder about and to nitpick that may be misplaced in fact. 
I am not an academic (as much as I try to believe I can be one) and my judgement may be misplaced. However, if we can agree but on one thing, it would be that nobody wants to read a wall of text because as they say: 
"ain`t nobody got time for that s***".
